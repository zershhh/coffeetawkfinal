### 2018 Fall NYU Shanghai Application Lab
# **CoffeeTawk Project**        

### Heroku App [link](https://fffinalcoffeetawk.herokuapp.com/)

### Project Idea:
A website for coffeeshop stuff to collect data for further data analysis.
 
### Project Introduction:
My website is collecting the following data and generate the correlations between the three data.
* Number of Customers
* Number of Seasonal Drinks
* Use of Buy-1-Get-1-Free Voucher

I choose these three data because from my fieldwork in the coffee shop, I want to find the correlation between the number of customers per order and the number of seasonal drinks they order. From my observations and records, I see the trend that more customers might order more seasonal drinks. Also I found some of the customers who used the Buy-1-Get-1-Free Voucher would be more likely to buy seasonal drinks because the seasonal drinks are the most expensive ones and people would regard using the voucher would save them more money.

### Project Interface:

* Tools: Html, CSS, Heroku
* Design 
  * Images+Select bar: Easy for stuff to understand and start collecting data
  * Alert: Indication of successfully submitted the data/calculate the correlation at the backend
